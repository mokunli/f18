# CSCI 1102 Computer Science 2

### Fall 2018

## Grading

Like most CS courses, CSCI 1102 is very much a "learn by doing" course. Reflecting this, grades will emphasize the problem sets. Grades will be computed on a 200 point scale. The points are distributed as follows:

+ 100 points over 10 problem sets; your lowest non-zero problem set score will be discarded and replaced by your average score for the other 9 problem sets;

+ 80 points over 3 exams --- 20 points for each of two midterms and 40 points for the final exam;

+ 20 points for class and piazza participation;

Grades will be recorded on the Canvas website.

#### Notes:

+ Unless specified otherwise, problem sets must be submitted by pushing your repository to GitHub by midnight on the due date. NB: under no circumstances at all can code be submitted for grading by attaching it to an email message. An attempt to submit code via email probably won't receive a reply notifying the sender that the attempted submission failed. 


+ Late problem sets will be penalized 20% each day.
+ Students missing an exam without prior permission of the instructor will receive a zero for that exam unless they provide a note from their doctor.
+ Any violation of the [university's policy on academic integrity](http://www.bc.edu/offices/stserv/academic/integrity.html) will result in a failing grade for the course.
