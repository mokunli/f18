# CSCI 1102 Computer Science 2

### Spring 2018

---

## About

One of the central issues in computer science is the question of how to represent things in a computer in such a way that our algorithms can manipulate the representations as required by a given application. By "as required" we mean that both the functional requirements (i.e., what the software system must do) and also the performance requirements (i.e., how efficiently the software does it) must be taken into account. Our programs can't take all day and they must execute well within the existing memory constraints.

This course is primarily concerned with the design and development of efficient data structures and algorithms. A second major theme is to further develop the student's software development skills. To that end we will stress programming methodology (e.g., data abstraction, modularity, good documentation) and we will make use of state of the art software engineering tools. This is very much a hands-on course. By the end of the course you should be able to design fairly complex programs that do interesting and useful things.

**CSCI 1102 Computer Science 2, meets in Fulton Hall 415, T Th 9AM â€” 10:15AM**.

### Screens When and Where

CSCI 1102 will have a screen-less classroom.  This means that **no open laptops, tablets, or smart-phones will be allowed.** All lecture notes and sample programs will be posted to the course website. If you have special circumstances that require you to bring a screen to class, please see me.
