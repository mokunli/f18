Don't be fooled by the title, this excellent book is for CSCI 1102 notwithstanding the fact that its title matches CSCI 3383.  This is a relatively high-level and rigorous introductory text on data structures and algorithms. It emphasizes scientific applications. We will make heavy use of the accompanying software libraries. The libraries are freely distributed on the [book website](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

This book is available in limited supply in the BC Bookstore and through [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322093778&sr=8-1) for about \$60 new, \$40 used and for rent at \$23.
